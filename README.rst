ProsperAPI
==========

|Build Status| |Coverage Status|

A collection of API resources for the general public to leverage `EVE
Prosper`_\ â€™s `EVE Online`_ market data.

These services are designed to be easy to deploy and maintain for any
member of the community. Though some private resources will require data
from our master host, this `Flask-Restful`_ project *should be easy to
distribute*.

Getting Started
===============

Though testing/developent is platform agnostic, the following resources
are required for production:

-  Debian Linux (Ubuntu16)
-  Python >3.5
-  `dh-virtualenv`_ >1.0

For Developers
--------------

Getting started is easy for developers. Just spin up a `virtualenv`_ and
install

    ``pip install . --extra-index-url=https://repo.fury.io/lockefox/``

Testing is designed to be easy too! Just run tests from setup.py

    ``python setup.py test``

**NOTES**

-  On Windows, numerical libraries are touchy. Have included manually
   compiled wheels in project
-  `fbprophet`_ is a complicated dedpendency. See `build documentation`_ for more
   notes
-  Mac is special, `fbprophet`_ is not supported, but everything else is

For Sysadmins
-------------

Please refer to our `build documentation`_ for step by step
